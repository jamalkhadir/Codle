Codle is an application that I created using React and NodeJS, and is a redefined version of the popular game "Wordle", where users are given 6 attempts to guess a randomly selected 5-letter solution word. In Wordle, the solution word is chosen randomly once per day from a massive list of 5-letter English words put together by the development team behind Wordle. I developed my game with changes in the rules so that only programming-related words are used, and that a new solution word is chosen every time the page is refreshed rather than having to wait the following day to play a new game. Following the rules of Wordle, the user is given hints based on the attempted words that they enter. If a particular letter in an attempted guess is highlighted as green, then the user knows that the solution word has that letter in that position. However, if a letter is yellow, then that letter is present in the solution word but is not in the correct position. Lastly, if a letter is gray then it is not in the solution word at all. Words attempted by the user must also be programming related, otherwise they will receive an error stating that their word is not in the word list and their attempt will not be counted. Good luck!
