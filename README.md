Codle is an application that I created using React and NodeJS which is a redefined version of the popular game "Wordle", where users are given 6 attempts to guess a randomly selected 5-letter word. In Wordle, the 5 letter words that can be the solution are comprised of a massive list of 5-letter English words put together by the development team behind Wordle. My game has a twist in that it only uses programming-related words. Following the rules of Wordle, the user is given hints based on the attempted words that they enter. If the any particular letter in an attempt is highlighted as green, than the user knows that the solution has that letter in that position. Furthermore, if a letter is yellow, then that letter is present in the word but is currently not in the correct position. Lastly, if a letter is gray then it is not in the word at all. Words attempted by the user must also be programming-related, otherwise they will receive an error stating that their word is not in the word list. Good luck!
